     dude, is my code constant time?
     DATE 2017
     https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1123.pdf

 This file measures the execution time of a given function many times with
 different inputs and performs a Welch's t-test to determine if the function
 runs in constant time or not. This is essentially leakage detection, and
 not a timing attack.

 Notes:

   - the execution time distribution tends to be skewed towards large
     timings, leading to a fat right tail. Most executions take little time,
     some of them take a lot. We try to speed up the test process by
     throwing away those measurements with large cycle count. (For example,
     those measurements could correspond to the execution being interrupted
     by the OS.) Setting a threshold value for this is not obvious; we just
     keep the x% percent fastest timings, and repeat for several values of x.

   - the previous observation is highly heuristic. We also keep the uncropped
     measurement time and do a t-test on that.

   - we also test for unequal variances (second order test), but this is
     probably redundant since we're doing as well a t-test on cropped
     measurements (non-linear transform)

   - as long as any of the different test fails, the code will be deemed
     variable time.
